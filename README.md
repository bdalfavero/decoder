## Tensor network decoding

This repository contains the code for my tensor network decoder. The following files form the `examples` directory produce the results in the report:
* `decode_errors.py`
* `two_contractor_test.py`
* `decoder_contractor_test.py`

Code for producing plots is provided in the `scripts` directory. The slurm files used to submit batch jobs are there as well, though you might need to modify them to get emails configured properly. There is a `requirements.txt` file for initializing a virtual environment.
